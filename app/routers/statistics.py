    This endpoint provides ways to let external users and applications to request for
    information collected on the platform.\n
    This interface enables external organization to gather aggregated meta-data on citizens mobility.\n
    Within the API boundaries, it is possible to parametrize requests by selecting timeframes, area of interests,
    mobility types and other details.\n
    To preserve userâ€™s privacy, it has been defined a lower threshold for the area selected.\n
    In addition, it has been enabled the possibility to extract, with other requests,
    the list of positions for the collected journeys.\n
    Furthermore, external organization can exploit an embedded mechanism that limit the visibility
    of their data with respect to the other users enabled to interact with the platform.\n
    The following diagram shows the final software design of the data extraction service.\n
