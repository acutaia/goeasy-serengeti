The *SEcure tRusted collEction aNd exchanGE of posiTion Information (*SERENGETI*)*
 software component is the main point of access of the GOEASY platform. It provides REST
based OAuth2 secured endpoints to enable authorized users and software to interact with the GEP features.
In addition to the application proxy features, it allows to feed the platform with personal tracking data collected
by the Trusted GOEASY Devices (such as the Smartphones running the ApesMobility application), to be
authenticated, anonymize, and stored on a Private Database. 

The overall endpoints offered by the current software are mainly divided as follows:

- [Data Feeding API](https://acutaia.github.io/goeasy-serengeti/serengeti/Data_Feeding_API)
- [Data Authentication API](https://acutaia.github.io/goeasy-serengeti/serengeti/Data_Authentication_API)
- [Data Inspection API](https://acutaia.github.io/goeasy-serengeti/serengeti/Data_Inspection_API)
- [Data Extraction API](https://acutaia.github.io/goeasy-serengeti/serengeti/Data_Extraction_API)
- [Administration API](https://acutaia.github.io/goeasy-serengeti/serengeti/Administration_API)
